3.  Challenge: How to download multiple pdf/data files using webscraping methods?

    To download multiple PDF or data files using web scraping methods, we need to identify the URLs of the files we want to download. This is typically done using a web scraping library like rvest in R to parse the HTML of the webpage and extract the URLs. Once we have the URLs, we can use a function like download.file() in R, in combination with a loop, to programmatically download each file.
