## Government data and parallel processing

1.  Run govdata01.R and parallel01.R - Task completed

2.  Start planning for storage and computational resources:

    a.  Note the space and time taken

    b.  Plan data management (e.g. database)

        It took 10.462103 minutes to get 234 records and the total size of PDFs downloaded was 106509630 bytes.

3.  Organize the data in data frames - Task completed.

4.  Learn other data storage methods (e.g. arrow, feather, parquet)

    After learning about these storage methods, I found that for large, complex datasets, Parquet is often the best choice due to its efficiency in storage and speed in analytics queries. For smaller datasets or when high-speed input output is more critical, Feather is a good choice.

    If you need to share data between different programming languages or tools, Arrow provides a great platform due to its language-agnostic design.
